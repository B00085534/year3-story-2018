Chapter 02

I trudged carefully towards Mira’s house, feeling a sudden irritating coldness halting me from taking another step.
Like I lost something precious but not knowing what. I clutched the ring in my hand harder. Ensuring myself that everyone 
has this feeling when they’re about to propose. I continued but my senses felt disturbed and the discomforting feeling 
buries itself into my head.

The sight of Mira’s house comes into view and the sight of her broken down door freezes me. I blink trying to deceive myself 
that I saw something different. I found myself picking up half of her door, my legs weakening, either from the sprint I made 
or the horrible thoughts that crept on my mind and trying to come up with some other situation that this led to other than the 
worst one I regretted most likely occurred.

My eyesight blurred from the tears. The floor painted with blood and a deformed body tossed aside by the hearth took all my 
breath. I threw myself at the body, trying to fool myself that it had to be somebody else. The familiar touch of her clothes, 
her sweet scent tainted by the smell of blood and her weight was all I needed. An overbearing amount of sadness fell on me and 
that sadness turned and twisted to anger. Feeling like I’m about to explode I started thrashing breaking everything in my reach. 

If I was still able I would continue but my bruised and bleeding hands woke me. I sat down not able to support myself any 
longer. In front of me a torn piece of paper with a hand print presented itself. The sign of the local bandits that taken up 
hold on the old ruins up the mountain.

My head suddenly cleared giving me one command, one objective, a single thought.
