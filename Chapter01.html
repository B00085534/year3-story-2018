Chapter 01

I walked back into my home town as usual. Taking in the familiar cold air, the uncomfortable 
calmness and the constant tension between every glance and gesture towards another person. 
It was not regularly like this. There have been murders occurring at the beginning of harvest 
this year. The people believe it’s because some of the households had a lack of intake and are 
now pointing fingers against one another. 

“Good morning, Delvin!” A shout cuts the silence.

I smiled. The one blessing I thank the Gods for gifting me, greeted me with her comforting cheer. 
The one person I trust in this unfortunate town. The local blacksmith and my lover, Mira.

“Good morning beauty.” I courted back.

She blushes and punches my shoulder. I winced, her strength from working hard showed. Another trait to adore her for. 

“Are we still having dinner?” I asked anxious she might possibly say no.

“Of course, we are” She gleams taking some of the firewood I collected for her. “I’ve prepared the food already. 
Go put those away and change. Then we can start”.

I hurried home not wasting one second. My excitement carrying my hands to move faster and my legs to quicken. 
Yearning to hear and be with my love again.
