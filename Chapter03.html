Chapter 03

I stand at the solid rock doors, the old ruins creating a dusty ancient atmosphere. My body loaded by the armour my blessing crafted for me. But my heart felt considerably more cumbersome. With my weighted heart I made my way in.
I get confronted with three burly men immediately. But the thought of my love deformed and lifeless filled my head and I lost it. Not uttering a single word, I slashed and slashed. My vision reddened, and my hearing lost from constant screams, but my anger seems never ending. After checking every room, not leaving one survivor I waited and slaughtered anything breathing that entered.
In my search I found valuable treasure and food stock that would last me years, but I felt no relief. My love leaving too vast of a hole to fill.
Coming back, we found that the bandits was the cause of the food shortage and murders thus releasing the curse of tension everyone had. Festivities made their way back, conflicts resolve themselves and the atmosphere brightened.
Everything returned to its old cheerful self. Except for me.

Epilogue

Though I forever lost a part of me I lived fulfilling my dreams of what hers would have been. Taking over the blacksmith shop and raising a family. My heart too wounded I adopted a beautiful child that had her eyes and smile.
